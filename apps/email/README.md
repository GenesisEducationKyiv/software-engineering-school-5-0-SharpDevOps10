MAIL_FROM=
```

## Running the Application

From the root directory of the whole project, run:

```

## Metrics

This microservice integrates Prometheus metrics. These tools enable observability,
help monitor system health, and assist in debugging and performance tuning.

Email service metrics are pushed to a Prometheus `Pushgateway` and exported in standard Prometheus format.

| Metric Name                          | Type      | Labels               | Description                                                |
|--------------------------------------|-----------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `email_send_total`                   | Counter   | `status`, `template` | Total email send attempts, categorized by success/failure. |
| `email_send_duration_seconds`        | Histogram | `template`           | Duration of email sending per template (e.g., `confirm`).  |
| `email_events_processed_total`       | Counter   | â€“                    | Total events received from the message queue.              |
| `template_validation_failures_total` | Counter   | `template`           | Number of failed template validations.                     |

### Viewing Metrics

Metrics are pushed periodically to a Pushgateway.

1. Pushgateway UI: Visit `http://localhost:9091` in your browser to view pushed metrics.
2. Prometheus with Grafana (optional): Configure Prometheus to scrape from Pushgateway to enable alerting and long-term
   storage. Open `http://localhost:3000` and add `Prometheus` as a data source. Use the following query to visualize
   email metrics:
